The system that we are modelling aims to model a car dealership/yard.

The program takes intput from a user and creates a car dealership object, which contains vehicles, managers and salesmen.
There are multiple vehicle variants, ranging from bikes to trucks.

The program will need to use dynamic arrays, objects/classes/types and i/o, in all aspects of the software.
Dynamic arrays will be used when creating the salesyard. 
The program will contain multiple objects/classes/types; 

salesyard class

staff class
    salesman class (sell cars)
        manager class (

vehicle class
    truck (towing capacity)
    bike (sold with inusrance??)
    coupe (is convertible, misc. performance)
